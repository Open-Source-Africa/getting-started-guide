## What is Open-Source?
**Open-source** is basically a type of software or creative work that's available for free to anyone who wants to use, modify, or share it. It's like a big playground where developers, engineers and creators can collaborate and build cool things together.

And the best part is that it's not just for the experts - anyone can get involved and contribute, no matter their skill level. So it's kind of like a big open party where everyone's invited, and the more people show up and bring their unique talents, the better the party gets.

## Why contribute to open source projects?
Contributing to open source projects can offer benefits such:
- Gaining professional experience and acquiring new skills
- Building a portfolio of world-class projects to use on your resume or CV
- Making valuable connections with like minded individuals
- Contributing to a larger community of developers and users.

 Additionally, it can be a fulfilling way to give back to the community and make a positive impact on the world.

- As each project is expected to utilize slightly varied stacks, there's a chance to explore and experiment with new technologies.
 
- In addition to acquiring new skills, participating in these projects allows you to gain valuable project experience to include on your resume or CV. Moreover, by building out your commit history on Github, which is highly valued by employers, you can showcase your proficiency. 
 
- However, the most significant benefit is learning to collaborate in a team environment, which is a crucial skill for becoming an outstanding developer or engineer.

## How can i contribute to a project?

**There are two options available: You can either join an existing project or create a new one:**

### **01: Joining an existing project.**

If you're new to joining a project, don't worry - it's a straightforward process. Start by browsing through the list of current projects and select one that catches your attention. Then, head over to the project's repository and check out the README file, which provides a guide on how to get started.

### **02: Creating a new project.**

We're constantly searching for fresh and interesting projects for our community to work on together! If you have an exciting project or idea that you believe the community would be interested in, please contact a member of the Management Team through slack with a comprehensive project brief.

## Structure of an open-source project:

Although every open-source community is unique, many follow a similar organizational structure. Spending years on one project may not prepare you for the norms, communication styles, and vocabulary of another project. However, understanding the different roles and overall process will help you adapt to any new project more quickly.

The typical open-source project has various types of people involved, including the author(s), owner(s), maintainers, contributors, and community members. Larger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on specific tasks. You can usually find this information on a project's website or in the repository's governance documentation.

Documentation is essential for every project and usually located in the top level of a repository. These files may include the license, README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and additional documentation, such as tutorials or governance policies.

Open-source projects also use several tools to organize discussions, including issue trackers, pull requests, and discussion forums or mailing lists. Some projects may also use chat channels for casual conversations, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

Reviewing these archives can provide you with a good understanding of how the community thinks and works.
