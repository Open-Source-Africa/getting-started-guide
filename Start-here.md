## What is Open-Source?
**Open-source** is basically a type of software or creative work that's available for free to anyone who wants to use, modify, or share it. It's like a big playground where developers, engineers and creators can collaborate and build cool things together.

And the best part is that it's not just for the experts - anyone can get involved and contribute, no matter their skill level. So it's kind of like a big open party where everyone's invited, and the more people show up and bring their unique talents, the better the party gets.

## Why contribute to open source projects?
Contributing to open source projects can offer benefits such:
- Gaining professional experience and acquiring new skills
- Building a portfolio of world-class projects to use on your resume or CV
- Making valuable connections with like minded individuals
- Contributing to a larger community of developers and users.

 Additionally, it can be a fulfilling way to give back to the community and make a positive impact on the world.
