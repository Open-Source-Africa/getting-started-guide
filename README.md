## A beginner's guide on how to contribute.

1. Go to the ```'Start-here.md'``` file in this directory for a brief introduction to open source and its significance

2. Click the ```'Fork'``` button on the [GitHub page of this repository](https://github.com/Open-Source-Africa/getting-started-guide).

For example, enter this command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/getting-started-guide.git
```
**Note:** Change ```<your-github-username>```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd getting-started-guide
   ```
5. To prevent merge conflicts, synchronize your fork before making any modifications:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Open-Source-Africa/getting-started-guide.git
git pull upstream main
```

**Note:** This is a space for experimentation, and we promote taking risks and learning from failures. Utilize this environment as a platform for practice and relish collaborating with others on projects that you create together. A large number of folks have attained practical know-how on "teamwork" by participating in such initiatives.
